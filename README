CREDENTIALS

This project uses the https://openweathermap.org/ API to get weather data. To begin using this project you must first copy the file "js/configTemp.js" into the same directory and rename it to "config.js". Then fill in the value of "openWeather" with your own API key. The newly created file "js/config.js" is ignored by git for security.
